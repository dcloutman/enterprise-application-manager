Purpose and Scope
-----------------

The Enterprise Application Tracker (EAT) is an experimental application inventory system specifically designed for tracking enterprise software application installations and their supporting infrastructure relationships within server-side environments. This proof-of-concept system addresses the need for centralized tracking of application deployments on servers while maintaining role-based security and basic compliance features.

**Important Scope Limitations:**

* **Server-Side Focus**: EAT tracks application installations on server environments only
* **No Physical Asset Management**: Does not inventory physical hardware (servers, network equipment, storage devices)
* **No Client-Side Tracking**: Does not track software installations on end-user devices or workstations
* **Application-Centric**: Focuses on enterprise business applications rather than system software or utilities
* **Future Expansion**: May integrate with physical asset management systems or expand to client-side tracking in future versions

Problem Statement
-----------------

Enterprise IT departments managing server-side application deployments face several challenges:

* **Application Deployment Tracking**: Scattered information about what applications are deployed where
* **Server-Application Relationships**: Complex dependencies between applications and their hosting servers
* **Database Dependencies**: Tracking which applications use which backend data stores
* **Environment Management**: Managing applications across development, staging, and production environments
* **Change Tracking**: Understanding application lifecycle events and configuration changes
* **Access Control**: Role-based access to application deployment information

Solution Overview
-----------------

EAT provides a basic platform for server-side application tracking through:

**Application Installation Tracking**
  * Basic inventory of enterprise applications deployed on servers
  * Application metadata and configuration tracking
  * Deployment relationship management

**Server Environment Management**
  * Server inventory focused on application hosting capabilities
  * Environment classification (development, staging, production)
  * Basic server configuration tracking for application deployment context

**Data Store Dependencies**
  * Tracking of backend databases and data storage systems
  * Application-to-database relationship mapping
  * Basic connection and dependency information

- Simple reporting functions

**Cloud Integration**
  * Basic cloud platform tracking for cloud-hosted applications
  * Simple resource and service inventory
  * Cost center and ownership information
  * Basic service configuration tracking

**Security and Compliance**
  * Role-based access control with five permission levels
  * Basic audit logging for activity tracking
  * Session-based authentication
  * Input validation and data sanitization

* **External Auditors**: System compliance verification

Introduction
============

The Enterprise Application Tracker is an experimental web application designed to provide basic inventory capabilities for business applications and their supporting infrastructure. This system serves as a proof-of-concept for centralized application tracking in enterprise environments.

What is the Enterprise Application Tracker?
--------------------------------------------

The Enterprise Application Tracker is a Django-based web application with a SvelteKit frontend that helps organizations maintain basic visibility into their software applications and supporting infrastructure. The system focuses on tracking business applications, their hosting servers, associated databases, and basic metadata.

**Development Status**

This is an experimental system currently in version 0.0.1. Development began on July 26, 2025, and the system should be considered a proof-of-concept rather than a production-ready solution.

**Primary Use Cases**

- **Application Inventory**: Maintain a basic catalog of business applications
- **Infrastructure Relationships**: Track which servers host which applications
- **Database Dependencies**: Record database and data store relationships
- **Basic Documentation**: Store contact information and basic application metadata
- **Change Tracking**: Log basic changes for audit purposes

**Current Limitations**

- Limited reporting and analytics capabilities
- Basic security implementation
- No physical asset tracking
- Minimal integration features
- Experimental features may change significantly

System Requirements
-------------------

**Production Environment**

* **Operating System**: Oracle Linux 8, RHEL 8+, Ubuntu 20.04+
* **Container Platform**: Docker Swarm or Kubernetes
* **Database**: MySQL 8.4+ or PostgreSQL 13+
* **Memory**: 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
* **Storage**: 100GB minimum, SSD recommended
* **Network**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3 required

**Development Environment**

* **Development OS**: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL2
* **Container Runtime**: Docker Desktop or Podman
* **Database**: MySQL 8.4 (via container)
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum
* **Storage**: 20GB available space

Architectural Principles
